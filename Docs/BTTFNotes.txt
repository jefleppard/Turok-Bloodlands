BTTF

Challenges
-The trilogy is largely about characters and the specific narrative around Doc & Marty
-Simulating this without building a real narrative-driven game will be a challenge
-This series is from the 80s and has a pretty specific demographic that gives a shit

Time Travel in Games
-Chrono Trigger does a great job of providing a linear narrative that takes the player through all of the eras in the game, then after Chrono dies, the game opens up and allows the player to drop in on any of the previously visited eras, affecting change to the game narrative, characters, and future eras.
-Reigns does a great job of distilling choices (and all other inputs) into simple binary (yes/no) inputs. Many of these choices are silly, for narrative purposes, or just world-building... but others actually affect the 4 main success criteria meters.
-Undertale does a great job of making you feel for the characters, impressing that compassion and humor are the solution (rather than traditional RPG violence). This often involves dialogue options in battle, and significant choices being made in the narrative.
-Kingdom Hearts does a great job of immersing you in the Disney universes. While iconic characters like Donald and Goofy are the core members of your RPG party, each universe visited lends one of its denizens to the  party. Summons and NPCs are also used to incorporate additional characters, while enemies and bosses are reserved for narratively appropriate characters.  

Hill Valley
-Hill Valley is an iconic setting for the BTTF universe. All the events of the trilogy take place here; the difference is time.
